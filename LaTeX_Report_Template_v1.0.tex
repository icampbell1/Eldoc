% Acronyms which have a 'short name' (2nd set of curly brackets) written in math form using the '$' are always listed before acroynms without the '$' in the short name
% Acronyms listed in this section, regardless of order here/in the source code, are ordered alphabetically in the PDF that is produced

\newacronym{ev}{EV}{Electric Vehicle}
\newacronym{soc}{SOC}{State of Charge}
\newacronym{soh}{SOH}{State of Health}	

% Default LaTeX behaviour is to only add to the list of acronyms/nomenclature those acronyms that are actually used in the text with '\gls{}'
% Using '\glsaddall' (below) ensures that ALL acronyms that are defined here are printed in the list of acronyms/nomenclature, regardless of whether or not they're called with '\gls{}'. Just comment-out the line below to enforce the default behaviour.

\glsaddall[types=\acronymtype]	

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New Command Definitions %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Analogous to writing your own function definitions in a language such as Python. LaTeX allows you write a command that can be called later in the source code

% New command: Ensures that superscripts & subscripts are placed vertically inline, rather than offsetting the super and subscripts relative to eachother. 
% Call this command by using \SPSB{superscriptgoeshere}{subscriptgoeshere}
\def\SPSB#1#2{\rlap{\textsuperscript{\textcolor{black}{#1}}}\SB{#2}}

% Example (below): writing mathematical equations inline in LaTeX

We can write equations and symbols in formatted columns on in-line, like the following character in this line $c\textsubscript{e}$. We can also insert Greek symbols $\phi\textsubscript{e}$ and fractions, for example: $\frac{R\textsubscript{SEI}}{a\textsubscript{s}}i\textsuperscript{Li}$.

\begin{comment}
If you have a lot of text that add as a comment, you can place it within these commands instead of using a \% symbol for every line. If you have a LaTeX keyword, such as the \% symbol in LaTeX, you can prevent LaTeX from recognising it as a keyword  by placing a backslash immediately before it.
\end{comment}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:BV}
i\textsuperscript{Li} = a\textsubscript{s}i\textsubscript{0} \left[\exp[\frac{\alpha\textsubscript{a}F}{RT}(\eta\textsubscript{s}-\frac{R\textsubscript{SEI}}{a\textsubscript{s}}i\textsuperscript{Li})] - \exp[\frac{\alpha\textsubscript{c}F}{RT}(\eta\textsubscript{s}-\frac{R\textsubscript{SEI}}{a\textsubscript{s}}i\textsuperscript{Li})]\right]
